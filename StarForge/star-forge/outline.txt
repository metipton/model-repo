POC -> You're missing the point
	Why growth in the short term is very hard.  Why POW valuations can be so much higher
	metaphor for walled garden with stack of gold in the middle -> what is the wall made of.
	Debunk the eco-friendly discussion -> why it doesnt matter and how it might be false
		still have to destroy a certain amount of value -> but destruction isnt transient
	How chain looks in steady state and how mining incentives play out, block rewards and taxation
	why POC has a better long term value proposition for storing value than POW in a deflationary system
